# Restart Summary

## Problem Statement
The `CorrectProductionScenarioTest`, which uses the full feature set and the `MixedFeatureInputLayer`, is failing. The model's predictions collapse, meaning it fails to learn to differentiate between premium and regular user segments.

## Investigation Summary & Progress

Our investigation has been guided by two critical and successful reference tests:

1.  **The Simplified One-Hot Test:** A version of `CorrectProductionScenarioTest` that was simplified to use a manual, 2-dimensional one-hot `float[]` array (`[1.0, 0.0]` for premium, `[0.0, 1.0]` for regular) passed successfully.
2.  **The `DirectFloatArrayTest`:** This test, which we created, also bypassed the `MixedFeatureInputLayer` and passed manually constructed `float[]` arrays to the `NeuralNet`. The success of these direct-input tests proves that:
    *   The core `NeuralNet` backpropagation logic for dense layers is working correctly.
    *   The optimizers and the fundamental training loop are sound.

Therefore, the bug must exist in the code path that is unique to the `MixedFeatureInputLayer`. This has led us to the following hypothesis:

**Current Hypothesis:** We suspect the bug is in the **sparse gradient aggregation code path** within `NeuralNet.java`. This specific code path is only triggered when `MixedFeatureInputLayer` is used. The theory is that the logic incorrectly uses only the embedding index to store gradients. This would cause gradients from different features (e.g., `ZONEID` and `DOMAIN`) to collide and overwrite each other whenever their separate dictionaries coincidentally produce the same index for different values, preventing the model from learning. While we are not yet 100% positive, this is the most likely remaining cause.

To confirm this, we have taken the following steps:
1.  **Created a `DictionaryTest`:** This test confirmed that separate dictionary instances do not share state.
2.  **Created a `MixedFeatureInputLayerTest`:** This test confirmed that the layer's forward and backward passes work correctly in isolation.

## Next Steps
1.  **Fix `NeuralNet.java`:** The immediate next step is to apply the suspected fix to the gradient aggregation logic in `NeuralNet.java`. This involves changing the `aggregatedSparseGradients` data structure to be keyed by `featureIndex` in addition to `embeddingIndex`, preventing potential collisions.
2.  **Final Verification:** After applying the fix, run the original, full `CorrectProductionScenarioTest`. If it passes, our hypothesis is confirmed, and the bug is fixed.
3.  **Cleanup:** Remove any temporary diagnostic test files that were created during the investigation.
